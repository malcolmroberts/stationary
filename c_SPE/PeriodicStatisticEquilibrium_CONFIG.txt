#define SPE_MinimumNumberOfSteps 2000 //integer, minimum number of steps. Must be at least pow(2,SPE_ConfirmationToTestWindowLogRatio).
#define SPE_MaximumNumberOfSteps 30000 //integer, if no stationarity is detected until this point, the simulation is stopped. Further tests are still conducted.
#define SPE_MinimumTailRatio 0.5 //double, indicates how long in relation to the transient part (warm-up) the tail should be.    //The user should bear in mind that after the warm-up phase the tail should be long enough to contain at least SPE_MinimumNumberOfCycles in order to allow for a significant sample size.
#define SPE_MinimumSampleSize 2000 //integer, absolut minmium length of tail. Should be big enough to incorporate two cycles of maximum tolerated cyclelength.
#define SPE_TestTimeBonus 0.05 //double, indicates the relative additional time that data will be covered if the sample size was to small for some reasons.

#define SPE_CONFIG_MinimumNumberOfCycles 10 //integer, after the dominant cycle-length is detected it is checked if enough data for a representative sample is given. If not, the new minimum length is calculated and the simulation commences.

#define SPE_Wilcoxon_Critical_zValue 4.00 //double , critical z-value. e.g. 4 -> p_Value <0.0001
#define SPE_Critical_Gamma 0.00 //double , defines the minimum gamma correlation needed to speek of SPE. Lower correlations will be neglected and instead checked for normal stationarity only. 
#define SPE_Critical_relMSE 0.05 //double, defines by how much the avg cycle must be a better predictor than the MSE.

#define SPE_AutocorrelationSensitivity 0.05 //double, Indicates the minimum value of AC necessary, absolute. Perhaps this should depend on the length of the time-series. (t-noise..)
#define SPE_AutocorrelationPeakSensitivity 0.05 //double, indicates the tolerance in AC we allow for assuming equivalence
#define SPE_PeriodicityACtolerance 0.1 //double, defines the area around the AC peak that is searched for the best-fit cycle length.

#define SPE_FixedTruncation 0 //int, 0 -> off, else -> truncate at point given.
#define SPE_MSESensitivity 0.05 //double, indicates how much to the left of the MinMSER (batch or AvgCycle) which is a weighted MSE of the tail we will truncate. E.g. the new truncation point is at the first position the the left of pos_minMSER where MSE<MSE(MinMSER)*(1+SPE_MSESensitivity); Even with a then constant but positive MSE the weighting will otherwise lead to a prior cut-off.

#define SPE_MaximumDeltaMeanTolerance 0.05 //float, defines the maximum tolerance allowed for the mean in the a) confirmation window frames b) test window frames and c) confirmation window vs. test-window.
#define SPE_MaximumDeltaVarTolerance 0.35 //float, defines the maximum tolerance allowed for the variance in the a) confirmation window frames.

#define SPE_FAST_VAR true //bool, toggles if for the confirmation window the variance is only calculated if the mean is inside the tolerance.
